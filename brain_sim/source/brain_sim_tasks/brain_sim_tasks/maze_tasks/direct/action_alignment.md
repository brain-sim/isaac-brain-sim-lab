# Action Configuration Alignment Analysis

## Direct RL Environment Analysis

### Action Space Configuration (from `spot_nav_avoid_env_cfg.py`)
```python
action_space = 3  # 3D action space
throttle_scale = 1.5
steering_scale = 1.0  
throttle_max = 4.5
steering_max = 3.0
```

### Action Processing (from `spot_nav_avoid_env.py/_pre_physics_step`)
```python
# Smoothing with factor [0.75, 0.3, 0.3]
actions = self._smoothing_factor * actions + (1 - self._smoothing_factor) * self._previous_action

# Scaling
self._actions[:, 0] = self._actions[:, 0] * self.throttle_scale    # First dimension
self._actions[:, 1:] = self._actions[:, 1:] * self.steering_scale  # Remaining dimensions

# Clamping  
self._actions[:, 0] = torch.clamp(self._actions[:, 0], min=0.0, max=self.throttle_max)     # [0, 4.5]
self._actions[:, 1:] = torch.clamp(self._actions[:, 1:], min=-self.steering_max, max=self.steering_max)  # [-3.0, 3.0]
```

### Low-Level Policy Interface (from `spot_nav_rough_env.py/_apply_action`)
```python
# Robot state variables (body frame)
base_lin_vel = self.robot.data.root_lin_vel_b      # [num_envs, 3]
base_ang_vel = self.robot.data.root_ang_vel_b      # [num_envs, 3]  
projected_gravity = self.robot.data.projected_gravity_b  # [num_envs, 3]
joint_pos = self.robot.data.joint_pos              # [num_envs, 12]
joint_vel = self.robot.data.joint_vel              # [num_envs, 12]

# Policy call with SpotRoughPolicyController
actions = self.policy.get_action(
    base_lin_vel,
    base_ang_vel, 
    projected_gravity,
    self._actions,  # 3D processed command
    self._low_level_previous_action,  # [num_envs, 12]
    default_pos,    # [num_envs, 12]
    joint_pos,
    joint_vel,
)

# Joint position computation
joint_positions = self._default_pos + actions * self.ACTION_SCALE  # ACTION_SCALE = 0.2
```

### Policy Controller Observation (from `spot_policy_controller.py/SpotRoughPolicyController`)
```python
obs = torch.zeros((num_envs, 48))
obs[:, 0:3] = base_lin_vel          # Body linear velocity
obs[:, 3:6] = base_ang_vel          # Body angular velocity  
obs[:, 6:9] = projected_gravity     # Projected gravity in body frame
obs[:, 9:12] = command              # 3D command from high-level policy
obs[:, 12:24] = joint_pos - default_pos  # Joint position deltas
obs[:, 24:36] = joint_vel           # Joint velocities
obs[:, 36:48] = previous_action     # Previous low-level action
```

## Manager-Based Implementation Alignment

✅ **Action Space**: 3D exactly matching Direct RL  
✅ **Smoothing**: [0.75, 0.3, 0.3] exactly matching Direct RL  
✅ **Scaling**: throttle_scale=1.5, steering_scale=1.0 exactly matching  
✅ **Clamping**: [0, 4.5] for throttle, [-3.0, 3.0] for steering exactly matching  
✅ **Robot State Variables**: Using body frame variables exactly as Direct RL  
✅ **Policy Interface**: SpotRoughPolicyController with exact same method signatures  
✅ **Observation Construction**: 48D observation with exact same layout  
✅ **Joint Position Computation**: ACTION_SCALE=0.2 exactly matching  

## Action Semantics

Based on the scaling and clamping patterns:

- **Dimension 0**: "Throttle" - Non-negative, scaled by 1.5, clamped [0, 4.5]
- **Dimensions 1-2**: "Steering" - Bipolar, scaled by 1.0, clamped [-3.0, 3.0]

The exact semantic interpretation (forward/lateral velocities, body-frame commands, etc.) depends on how the pre-trained low-level policy was trained. The Manager-Based implementation preserves the exact same interface and processing pipeline as the Direct RL environment.

## Key Differences from Original Manager-Based Design

**Removed** (incorrect assumptions):
- ❌ `lateral_scale` parameter (not in Direct RL)
- ❌ Individual velocity limits (handled by low-level policy)
- ❌ `_previous_command` variable (should be `_previous_action`)

**Corrected** (to match Direct RL):
- ✅ Variable naming: `_previous_action` instead of `_previous_command`
- ✅ Scaling logic: First dimension vs remaining dimensions
- ✅ Robot state access: Body frame variables (`root_lin_vel_b`, etc.)
- ✅ Policy controller: Embedded implementation matching Direct RL exactly
